This page provides everything you'll need to know about getting started with the geometry library.

The Geometry Template Library, or GTL, is a C++ library of container classes and algorithms.

It provides many of the basic algorithms and data structures of computer science.

The GTL is a generic library, meaning that its components are heavily parameterized:
almost every component in the GTL is a template. 

You should make sure that you understand how templates work in C++ before you use the GTL.
